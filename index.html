                    <p>One of my favorite pictures of a baseball by a tree. It gived off childhood memories of the area I grew up in, swinging

                    my friends and I went through.

                    <h2>How Long I've Been Playing</h2>
                    <p>I started playing the game at the age of 4 years old. 
                    I started in tee-ball all the way to my senior year of high school.

                    <h2>What does this sport mean to me</h2>
                    <p>Baseball was a blessing in disguise. I faced a lot of challenges when it came to this sport. Whether it was losing by a comeback 
                        or how to cope with unfair treatment. But in the end I learned to grow and understand how the 
                        real world works.

                    <h2>What position did I play?</h2>
                    <p>In little league and middle school I was a pitcher and an outfielder. 
                        But once I started high school baseball the coaches wanted me for my speed
                    and my hitting so I moved between a left fielder and a designated hitter. </p>

                    winning streak. </p>

                        the most was Trea Turner. Him and I both had speed and I mimicked his swinging stance.

                <p>My favorite baseball movie is Moneyball. Because it tell the story of a real life underdog story of the Oakland Athletics.
                It tells the compelling story of how the team was able to compete with big market teams with a small budget.
